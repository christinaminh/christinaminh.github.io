    <h1>My Journey into Programming</h1>
    <div class="about">

      <article class="journey">
        <section class="journey-intro">
          <h2>"There has to be a better way..."</h2>
          <p>What sparked my interest in coding was using Microsoft Power Automate to improve processes at my workplace. 
            I previously worked as a prosthetist orthotist, fitting patients with prosthetic limbs and bracing. 
            I was frustrated that many of our existing processes were redundant. 
            So, to automate those time-consuming tasks,  I created workflows in Power Automate and learned the basics of conditionals, loops, and arrays.</p>  
        </section>
        
        <section class="journey-realization">
          <h2>"Wait, did I just make that work?"</h2>
          <p>I quickly realized that I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect, like solving a puzzle. 
            One could say I was a bit obsessed. Sometimes I would finish seeing a patient and immediately get back to working on optimizing a workflow. 
            I was surprised how much I found myself relishing the feeling when a process I had improved was now working as intended and much more efficiently than before. 
            Just as with patient care, programming requires creative problem solving. 
            Everytime I solve a little problem, it triggers that reward system in my brain with sweet, sweet positive reinforcement!
            After doing tutorials, like Ada's introductory curriculum, Jumpstart, it has cemented the fact that I can be in this space. 
            I don’t have to be a hacker or a gamer, or have been coding since I was 10.</p>  
        </section>
  
        <section class="journey-ada">
          <h2>"What now?"</h2>  
          <p>Seriously making the move into tech seemed daunting without a degree in computer science.
            How do I even get my foot in the door?
            With encouragement from my partner, I applied to Ada Developers Academy, a revered coding school for women and gender diverse adults.
            Every Ada alum I spoke to was passionate about the Ada community. 
            They all felt supported and felt like everyone was there to lift each other up.
            Coming from a traditional education with over-crowded classes of 200-300 students, I have memories of people warning me about hyper-competitive classmates sabotaging labs to get ahead.
            So, a program that emphasizes collaboration and community sounded like make-believe.
            Even now, actually getting into / being at Ada, I am still in disbelief!</p>
        </section>
  
        <section class="journey-goal">
          <h2>"What to do with my newfound powers?"</h2>
          <p>I want the best of both worlds!
            As a health professional, I see the potential in programming to improve health outcomes. 
            With programming, I can help a wider audience. 
            I've worked personally with hundreds of patients but with web and software development, I could potentially reach millions of people. 
            Whether through improving accessibility of clinical resources on a website, or improving patient education with an app, there is potential to make a greater impact with coding.</p>
